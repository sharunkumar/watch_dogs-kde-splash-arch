## Installation Instructions

I haven't published this on the KDE store (yet). For now, you can manually install using the following commands `at your own risk ;)`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharunkumar/watch_dogs-kde-splash-arch.git
cd watch_dogs-kde-splash-arch
mkdir -pv ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/com.sharunkumar.watchdogs
cp -r . ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/com.sharunkumar.watchdogs
```

After this, `Watch_Dogs x Arch Linux` splash creen will be availabe in settings.
